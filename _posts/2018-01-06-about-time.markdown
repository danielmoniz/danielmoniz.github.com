It's about time.

I haven't written a blog entry in ages. This blog is for *me* this time. I'll throw any knowledge here that needs an explanation I'm likely to forget. If it's useful for someone else, that's a bonus.

It's also time to create a real-time online multiplayer game. I've built a turn-based strategy game in the past called [Generals][generals]. It's a deep slow-paced strategy game. It was built to play with a friend of mine that moved away. I'm very proud of it (the game, not the website - judge my black background/white text all you like), but it would be fantastic to build and play something a little snappier.

This blog is intended to chart the progress - including the failures and shortcomings - of an online Tower Defense game. I'm building this one with a friend who's learning to code, and I'm doing my best to stay away from the game content itself. My job is to build out the framework and the online connectivity. His job is to do whatever he can manage!

Lastly, it's about time because the I threw together a simple framework for a game on Nov. 12, 2017. I'll be blogging in retrospect for a little while until (hopefully) I catch up to the present. A corollary of this is that some posts will inevitably be anachronistic.

Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more...


Oh, yes, and I write haiku.

Projects start anew
Drifting through wandering minds
Graveyard gets a stone
