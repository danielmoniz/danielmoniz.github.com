The goal of this blog is to charter the process of building an online Tower Defense game in JavaScript. I would normally seek to use an existing framework, but this time I set about building my own. For science.

The framework uses a library called [MobX][mobx-github] at its core. It's a wonderful thing and I'm a big proponent of it. If you want to get started with MobX, try this [short introduction][mobx-get-started].

My name is Daniel Moniz. I like gaming (board or video), coding, dancing, painting, teaching, and quite a bit more. I teach Web Development at [Bitmaker][bitmaker] in Toronto. My current go-to video game is [Rocket League][rocket-league].

If you want to know more about me, you'll probably have to ask.
